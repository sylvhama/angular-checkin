# Angular Checkin
Checkin app made with Angular. The staff of HSK were using this app in order to check the list of guests via their iPad. The app could storage the requests if the device was offline and execute then when the network was back. Pictures: https://www.behance.net/gallery/44236015/HSK-First-Thursdays-afterwork-party
